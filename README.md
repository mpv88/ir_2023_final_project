## PageRank Algorithm Implementation

- 1 On a dataset of webpages to be decided (main problem is of finding a small and significant dataset). done?
- 2 Implement the PageRank algorithm[1][2]. done? 
- 3 Also implement the ability to get a list of pages and use them to define the jump vector, thus performing topic-specific PageRank. done?

## Folder structure
Current folder contains a simple implementation of a templated Red-Black Tree class, together with its const-iterator.

* `requirements.txt` folder includes a `bmk.py` file to load
* `src` folder includes a `bmk.py` file to load
* `data` folder includes a `bmk.py` file to load
* `test` folder includes both a `tests.cpp` file containing the official unit-tests for the above mentioned classes -all performed with the Boost.Test framework-, paired with an unofficial `main.cc` file, aimed at showing how to use most part of classes' features.

## Execution
Download the repository on your computer.
Run the requirements file to install the dependencies needed to run the project.
Execute the `main.ipynb` notebook following the instructions which contains.
